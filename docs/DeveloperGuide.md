## 1. About This Guide

This document serves as a developer guide for Calo App with sufficient and comprehensive overview of the software
so that new developers, like you, will have a working knowledge of the application by the end of the guide.  

Note that this guide only provide reasonable depth. By no means this guide serves as a replacement for the actual code. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Setting Up

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

## 3. Design

### 3.1. Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ExerciseMainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

![Class Diagram of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2. UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExerciseListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 3.3. Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ExerciseBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an exercise).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 3.4. Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the Exercise book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Exercise>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `ExerciseBook`, which `Exercise` references. This allows `ExerciseBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Exercise` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>

![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### 3.5. Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the exercise book data in json format and read it back.

### 3.6. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1. Archive
(Phyo Han)  

Since Calo always stores all the exercises that the user did in the past, it is always a good idea to archive past exercises
so that the user can start afresh without the past records slowing down the performance of the application. Therefore, Calo
provides the user the `archive` function to stores these records. 

#### 4.1.1. Implementation
This section describes how the `archive` command is implemented. Unlike all the other command that only needs to interact
with `Model` component, the `archive` command needs to interact with `Storage` component which is responsible for reading
and writing `.json` file to the system, with the proper formatting for future read. 

To implement this, before executing `ArchiveCommand`, the `LogicManager` will pass `Storage` to the `ArchiveCommand`.  

A high level illustration of the executation is given in the following sequence diagram.


Step 1: Users enter the command which will consists of the keyword `archive`, the parameter `f/` followed by the file location.
This input is stored as a `String`.  
Step 2: The `String` is then passed to `ExerciseBookParser` which will cascade the `String` into meaning parts.  
Step 3: `ExerciseBookParser` create the `ArchiveCommand` and set the `Storage` component for `ArchiveCommand`.  
Step 4: `ExerciseBookParser` passes the `ArchiveCommand` back to the `LogicManager` and the `LogicManager` executes the command.
Step 5: During the executation, `ArchiveCommand` interacts with `Storage` who will write to the Local File on the user's computer.  
Step 6: If the user has no permission to write on the specific file location, an error message will appear on user screen.
Else, a success message will appear on the user Response Box.  

![Archive Sequence Diagram](images/ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png)


#### 4.1.2. Design Consideration

**Aspect**: How to decide the file path?

Alternative 1 (current choice): Have the user specify the file location and file name to store the archived file.
* Pros: Easier to implement. The user have the freedom on where to store and what to call the archived file. 
* Cons: Error prone. The user need to enter the file location  specifically whcih may be difficult for users who are used
to GUI.
* Reasons for choosing: Though this choice is more error prone, we decide that since our app is Command-Line Interface,
our users are likely accustomed to entering file location and the freedom to decide the location and name is always nice
to have. 


Alternative 2: Have a dedicated file location that the file will be stored.
* Pros: Easier for the user to archive.
* Cons: Difficult for the system to give a meaningful name to the archived file. If we were to name the file as `file_1`,
`file 2` etc, we need to check if there exists such file name first.



### 4.2. Displaying Graph of Calories Burnt
(Phyo Han)  

Since Calo aims to encourage the user to get active and track his progress, a graph of how much calories burnt for the past
few days can motivate the user to push further.

#### 4.2.1. Implementation
After each command, the UI will render itself through `MainWindow.fillInnerPart()` to update all the Ui Component. So
during this rendering process, `CaloriesGraph` takes in `HashMap` that contains the `Date` as the key and total `Calories` burn
for that day as the value. `CaloriesGraph` will then take values for the most recent 7 days (including today) and display
them on the Calories Graph.


Step 1: User enter a valid command.  
Step 2: The command is passed to the `LogicManager` which parse and execute the command.  
Step 3: After the update is done, `MainWindow` called `getCaloriesByDay()` which is a HashMap that contains the summarised information.  
Step 4: `MainWinodw` re-render all its `Ui` component including `CaloriesGraph`.  

![Flow Diagram for Calories Graph](images/CaloriesGraphFlowDiagram.png)

The following is the Sequence Diagram that describes the process in slightly more detail, including the method call.  
![Sequence Diagram for Calories Graph](images/CaloriesGraph.png)
`

#### 4.2.2. Design Consideration

**Aspect**: How to generate the CaloriesGraph?

Alternative 1 (current choice): Let the `LogicManager` passes a `HashMap<String,Integer>` that has `Date` as a key and
sum of `Calories` as a Integer value to `MainWindow` after each command.
Pros: Easy to implement.

Alternative 2: Convert the `HashMap<String,Integer>` that 
Pros: Follow the Design Pattern (Observer) and less stress on Call Stack (explained below)
Cons: Needs of Refactoring. Calo team has implemented the CaloriesGraph before the idea of Observer Pattern is introduced
to us. 

**Reason for Not refactoring**:   
The main reason is that it will not significant improvement in the performance of `Calo`, since the Ui needs to be re-rendered
everything after a command anyway. The only downside to current implementation is the stress put on the call stack since
in order to get the `HashMap` in `UniqueExerciseList` that contains the relevant information, it needs to be called through numerous
classes, as shown below. Current version of Calo is still 'light' enough for the system to handle the stress, but given time
`CaloriesGraph` should be refactored to fulfill the Observer Design Pattern especially when `Calo` get more complicated.

![Calories Graph Call Stack](images/CaloriesGraphCallStack.png)

### 4.3. Template
(Roy)  
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
I added the template class which stores information about a template. The template class has attributes name, calories,
muscleTags, and tags. The class has the get methods for the different attributes and a toString method to convert the 
template to a string in a more readable format. The class also has one parseToArgument() method which converts the 
template to the command argument. The class has one static method writeToFile which takes in template lists as parameter
and write the content of the list into the file. The class also has an equals method which takes in a template object 
and check whether the template object is equal to the template itself.
I also added a templateList class which stores the information about the template list in the app. The class has the 
following static methods:
-	getTemp: returns the template that has a specific name
-	addTemplate: add the template into the template list
-	load: load the template list from the file
-	readTask: read the template list from the file
-	checkEqual: Check whether the given template is equal to any of the template in the list
-	reset: empty the content of templatelist
The methods in the templateList classes are all static because it will be easier to just call the method in the 
templateList instead of having to create a new templateList object.
Two new parsers are also created for the command of creating a new template and the command of adding exercise from the 
template respectively. The parse method in AddExerciseFromTemplateParser parses the command of adding the exercise 
using the template and returns a new AddCommand object. The parse method in AddTemplateCommand parses the command 
of creating a new template and returns a new AddTemplateCommand object.
The template list is stored in the data file folder as a txt file.

### 4.4. GoalBook
Author: Nauman Sajid
Calo has been designed to ensure that a user is accountable for this own progress. A key aspect of this accountability is
ensuring that the user sets clear goals and meets them. To achieve this we have created a goalBook which is similar
to the exerciseBook. The goalBook helps the user track and update his goals.


#### 4.4.1. Implementation
The goalBook is implemented via a `HashMap` which makes it distinct from an ExerciseBook. The goal command creates a 
goal with the `Key` being the `Date` and the `Value` being an `Calorie` goal. The goalBook is updated whenever an exercise
is added or deleted for a particular Date.


#### 4.4.2. Design Consideration

*Aspect*: Should the goalBook be separate from the Exercise Book?

Alternative 1 (current choice): Separate. 
Pros: Ensures SRP principle.


Alternative 2: Joint Book.
Pros: Fewer files.

*Reason for option 1*:   
Option 1 allows easier debugging. As the goal Book has been seperated from the Exercise Book.

### 4.5. Updating an exercise

Author: Lee Wei Min

This section details how an `Exercise` is modified using the `update` command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The update command 
updates an existing exercise, where all fields are optional but at least one field to update must
be specified. For more details, please refer to the [update section](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w17-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#33-update-exercises--update) of the user guide
</div>

#### 4.5.1. Implementation

We will use the following example command: `update 1 d/30 c/260 m/chest t/home`.

The below sequence diagram details the execution flow:

![UpdateSequenceDiagram](images/UpdateSequenceDiagram.png)

Here are the steps:
- Step 1: `LogicManager` calls its  `execute` method, supplying the argument "update 1 d/30 c/260 m/chest t/home", which was entered by the user.

- Step 2: `LogicManager` calls the `exerciseBookParser`'s `parseCommand` method, supplying the user input.

- Step 3: In `parseCommand`, the user input is parsed and its command word (`update`) is matched to the `UpdateCommandParser`. `UpdateCommandParser`'s `parse` method is called, passing in the parsed arguments.

- Step 4: In `UpdateCommandParser`'s `parse` method, a `EditExerciseDescriptor` object
is created. Each field of the parsed arguments are added to the `EditExerciseDescriptor` object. `UpdateCommandParser` then creates an `UpdateCommand` object containing the index of the `exercise` to edit and the `EditExerciseDescriptor` object. In the sequence diagram, the argument `index` refers
to the `Index` object representing the index of the first exercise, while `editExerciseDescriptor`
refers to the `EditExerciseDescriptor` object that contains the data (from the parsed
arguments) to update.

- Step 5: `LogicManager` obtains the `UpdateCommand` object, which is referenced by the `command` variable. It then executes the `execute` method of  the `UpdateCommand` object.

- Step 6: In the `execute` method, the `UpdateCommand` object calls `getFilteredExerciseList` to 
to obtain `lastShownExerciseList`. The `Exercise` to edit is retrieved from the `lastShownExerciseList` using the `index`, and assigned to `exerciseToEdit`. Another `Exercise` object, named `editedExercise` is created to hold the data to be updated. The `UpdateCommand` object then calls the `setExercise` method of `Model`, with `exerciseToEdit` and `editedExercise`.

- Step 7: A new `CommandResult` is created containing the message to be displayed to the user,
which is "Edited Exercise: Name: running Description: 30 Date: 10-12-2020 Calories: 260 Muscles worked:[chest] Tags: [home]". This `CommandResult` is returned to `LogicManager`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The activation bar
of commandResult should be joined to the side of the box representing the commandResult instance.
Due to a limitation of PlantUML, it is not possible to do so here.
</div>

#### 4.5.2. Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Process of updating the new data in `model`

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice)**: Replace `Exercise` to be updated in `UniqueExerciseList` of `ExerciseBook` with another `Exercise` object containing the updated data.

  - Pros:
    - Atomic updates.
  - Cons:
    - May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
    - Eg. If only one field of the original `Exercise` object will be updated, another `Exercise`
      object will still be created containing the original data of the unchanged fields.

<br>

- **Alternative 2**: Update the fields of the original exercise one at a time.

  - Pros:
    - Will use less memory (no new `Exercise` object will be created)
  - Cons:
    - If an error occurs in the middle of the process, the fields which were updated would not recover the original values.

#### Summary

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `update` command:

![UndoRedoState5](images/UpdateActivityDiagram.png)

### 4.6. Searching for specific `exercise`

(Xinyi)

This section addresses how the `find` and `recall` commands work. 

The `find` command allows users to search through the Exercise Book based on what users enter for the `Field`s. Users should enter at least one `Field`. The search results can then be displayed in the GUI's Exercise Book.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
`Field`s here indicate which `Exercise` attributes we are interested in. Exact search finds `Exercise` objects with values that exactly match the user-specified values of the fields (`Name`, `Description`, `Date` ,`Calories`).
Meanwhile, keyword search finds matches for the user-entered keywords in any part of the `Name` or any part of the `Description`.
If the user uses exact search and keyword search together, it will find `Exercise` objects that match both the exact search and keyword search.
</div>

Meanwhile, the `recall` command allows users to search for the most recent exercise with the specific name entered by the user.

The above commands rely on `FindCommand` and `RecallCommand` objects respectively. Objects of both classes use a `Predicate<Exercise>` object to filter through the `Exercise` list,
and the exercises that evaluate the predicates to be true will be listed in GUI Exercise List.

#### 4.6.1. Implementation

To search via the user-specified `Exercise` attributes, We use `FindCommandParser` to create the `PropertiesMatchPredicate` with all the user inputs. This predicate returns true only when the exercise matches all the given fields.
This predicate is then used to construct a new `FindCommand` object, which changes the GUI display when executed.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `find` command works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

How the `find` command works:

Step 1: `LogicManager` executes the user input, using `ExerciseBookParser` to realise this is a `find` command, and create a new `FindCommandParser` object.

Step 2: The `FindCommandParser` object parses the user-entered arguments, and creates a `PropertiesMatchPredicate`.

Step 3: This `PropertiesMatchPredicate` object is  then used to construct a new `FindCommand` object, returned to `LogicManager`.

Step 4: `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method of the created `FindCommand`, which filters for `Exercise` objects that evaluate the predicate created previously to be true.
It then returns a new CommandResult object reflecting the status of the execution. These changes are eventually reflected in the GUI.

The `find` command therefore searches through the existing Exercise List and then displays the relevant search results in the GUIâ€™s Exercise List.

To search for the most recent exercise with the user-specified `Name`, we use `RecallCommandParser` to parse the user input and create a new `RecallCommand` object with the parsed input.
The `RecallCommand` then goes through the existing Exercise List to find the most recent date, creates the `TheMostRecentDatePredicate`, and updates the GUI display when executed.

The sequence diagram below demonstrates how the `recall` command works:
![recallSequenceDiagram](images/recallSequenceDiagram.png)

How the `recall` command works:

Step 1: `LogicManager` executes the user input, using `ExerciseBookParser` to realise this is a `recall` command, and create a new `RecallCommandParser` object.

Step 2: The `RecallCommandParser` object parses the user-entered arguments, and creates a `RecallCommand` object which is returned to `LogicManager`.

Step 3: `LogicManager` calls the `execute` method of the created `RecallCommand`, which creates the `TheMostRecentDatePredicate` and filters for `Exercise` objects that evaluate the predicate created previously to be true.
It then returns a new CommandResult object reflecting the status of the execution. These changes are eventually reflected in the GUI.

The `recall` command therefore searches for the most recent exercise with the specified name in the existing Exercise List and then displays the relevant search results in the GUI.

#### 4.6.2. Design considerations

##### Aspect: Case-sensitivity for user inputs
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The inputs for `Name`, `Description`, and `Keyword` are case-insensitive.
  * Pros: More user-friendly.
  * Cons: Cannot get precise results if the user wants to search in a case-sensitive way.

* **Alternative 2:** The inputs for `Name`, `Description`, and `Keyword` are case-sensitive.
  * Pros: Users can get exact match for their inputs. e.g. Push Up will not match push UP.
  * Cons: It is likely that users cannot clearly remember the case of `Name`s and `Description`s of the exercises. The `find` command will be harder for the user to use.

##### Aspect: How to find and display the most recent exercise
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Goes through the Exercise Book to find the most recent date and filters for the `Exercise` with specified `Name` and `Date`
  * Pros: Easy to implement. Uses the same exercise list as other commands do.
  * Cons: Users cannot get other information except for the most recent `Exercise`.

* **Alternative 2:** Get all the `Exercise`s with the specified name and reorder them by most recent.
  * Pros: Users can take a look at other similar `Exercise`s besides the most recent one.
  * Cons: Needs to create another Exercise List. Other commands will not work on the newly created list.
